### ☁️  About the Reverie Project ☁️
The Reverie Project is a small fan-led project that is made to preserve the history of the Google Daydream View and keeping the VR platform alive. 

The Google Daydream View was a VR platform created by Google that allowed users to immerse themselves into virtual reality through a ['daydream-compatible'](https://support.google.com/daydream/answer/9232592?hl=en) device.

Unfortunately, Google had discontinued the Daydream View in 2019. As of 2024, you can no longer download apps through the Daydream View headset as the servers have been shutdown. However, you can still sideload the apps and acces the menu through the headset.

With this in mind, the Reverie Project will provide tutorials on how to allow your phone to become 'daydream-compatible' and provide all available apps and games that currently work on the Daydream View headset.
